# 🌍 Visualizing Global COVID-19 Impact with Tableau

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **interactive Tableau dashboard** visualizing global COVID-19 trends, focusing on confirmed cases, deaths, and population-level infection rates across countries and continents.

The goal of this project is to transform raw COVID-19 data into a **clear, intuitive visual narrative** that allows users to explore global patterns and compare the impact of the pandemic across regions over time.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Visualize global COVID-19 cases and deaths at a high level  
- Compare total deaths across continents  
- Analyze the percentage of population infected by country  
- Track infection trends over time for selected countries  
- Practice building stakeholder-friendly dashboards in Tableau

The dashboard highlights the following key metrics:

- **Global KPIs**
  - Total confirmed cases
  - Total deaths
  - Death percentage (deaths / cases)

- **Geographical Analysis**
  - Percent population infected by country (world map)
  - Total deaths per continent (bar chart)

- **Time-Series Analysis**
  - Percent population infected over time
  - Country-level trend comparisons

The visualizations are designed to support both **high-level monitoring** and **country-specific exploration**.
